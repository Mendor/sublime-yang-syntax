# Syntax Highlighting for Yang
This is a Yang syntax highlighting package for Sublime Text / TextMate.

## Installation

### via Sublime Text Package Control
Recommend to install this package through **Package Control** (use the keyword `Yang` to find this plugin). Or download this package and rename it as you like, then move it into the Packages folder of Sublime Text.

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select Yang-Syntax when the list appears.
* Package Control will automatically keep Twee up to date with the latest version.

### via Git

Clone this repository into the Packages directory.

If you need to find the Packages directory, access the Console (Control+`) and enter the following command:

    print sublime.packages_path()

### via Manual
